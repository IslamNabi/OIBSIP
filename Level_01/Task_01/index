    <h1>Some Cool Stories</h1>
    <div class="flex-rows">
      <h2>The Birth of a Capital</h2>
      <p>
        In the early 1960s, Pakistan was in search of a new capital city to replace Karachi,
         which was becoming overcrowded and difficult to manage. After careful consideration,
          a picturesque site at the foothills of the Margalla Hills was chosen for its
           strategic location, climate, and beauty. Islamabad was designed by the renowned Greek architect
            and town planner, Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis. His vision brought to life a city
             that balances nature with modernity, incorporating green belts, large parks,
              and wide avenues, making Islamabad a unique and tranquil capital. The city’s development
               marked a significant milestone in Pakistan’s history,
                reflecting the country’s aspirations and growth.</p>

      <h2>The Faisal Mosque: A Gift from Saudi Arabia</h2>
      <p>
        One of Islamabad’s most iconic landmarks, the Faisal Mosque, stands as a symbol of
         Pakistan’s deep-rooted friendship with Saudi Arabia. Named after King Faisal bin
          Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, who funded its construction, the mosque’s design 
          was selected through an international competition and brought to life by 
          Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay. Completed in 1986, the mosque’s modern and 
          minimalist design departs from traditional domes and minarets, featuring a 
          striking triangular prayer hall and four towering minarets. The Faisal Mosque 
          can accommodate over 100,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest in the 
          world, and its unique architecture continues to attract visitors from around
           the globe.</p>

      <h2>The Enchanted Trail of Daman-e-Koh</h2>
      <p>
        Daman-e-Koh, a popular viewpoint in the Margalla Hills, offers breathtaking
         panoramic views of Islamabad. The journey to this scenic spot is as enchanting 
         as the destination itself. As visitors ascend the winding trails, they are 
         surrounded by lush forests and diverse wildlife, including monkeys, exotic birds, 
         and even the occasional leopard. The viewpoint provides a spectacular vista of 
         the city, especially at sunset when the sky is painted in hues of orange and pink. 
         Local legend has it that Daman-e-Koh was once a retreat for ancient sages and 
         mystics who sought peace and inspiration in the hills. Today, it remains a 
         beloved spot for both locals and tourists seeking a tranquil escape from the 
         hustle and bustle of city life.</p>
